# Software-Engineering-Project
Finding obsolete or duplicate comments on stack overflow. In this project I used stack overflow dataset until June 2021. 
Performed a task on Stack Overflow dataset to observe the obsolete content in the answers.
Divide the dataset in quantitative and qualitative analysis parts, for understanding the result in a better way.
In this project obsolete answers are obtained with respect to the amount of time, top 20 tags appeared with each answer,
specific reason behind the obsolete content and obsolete content observed by users.
